# Brain Disease Classification

## Project Overview

### Objective

Develop a machine learning model to classify brain diseases from medical images. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to analyze and identify patterns in brain scans, providing accurate disease diagnosis.

### Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Image normalization and augmentation to improve model generalization
   - Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract features from medical images

3. **Model Training:**
   - Implementing architectures for effective training
   - Fine-tuning pre-trained models on the brain disease dataset

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
   - Cross-validation to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting

### Technical Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.6+
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** FastAI
- **Development Environment:** Kaggle, Colab

This project demonstrates proficiency in image processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, showcasing a comprehensive approach to solving real-world medical diagnosis problems using deep learning techniques.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BariBariGood/Brain-Disease-Classifier/edit/main/readme.md
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook:**

    Open the `brain_disease_classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all the cells to preprocess the images, train the model, and classify brain diseases.

2. **Data Preprocessing Steps:**

    The notebook includes the following preprocessing steps:
    - Image normalization and augmentation
    - Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets

3. **Model Training:**

    Train the model using the preprocessed data. The notebook provides various configurations for training different deep learning architectures.

4. **Disease Classification:**

    Use the trained model to classify brain diseases from new medical images. The model outputs the probability of each disease class.
